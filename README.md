## The React Framework the Web

<ins>NextJS</ins> makes building large scale React apps easier. It enhances React by adding many core features which you have to add to React apps on your own otherwise. such as routing. You don't have to add as many third party libraries to solve common problems, which you need in bigger apps.

## Key Features & Benefits
- <ins>Built-in Server-side Rendering</ins> <!-- is all about preparing the content of a page on the server instead of on the client. If you inspect the source code of a loaded React page, you will notice the page is pretty empty. Only have a basic HTML skeleton here. If you have a public page with a lot of content, should be found through search engines. Then SEO, search engine optimization does matter. The search engine crawlers will only see the initially empty HTML page which we get from a server. The content is not picked up by search engine crawlers and that can be a problem. (ReactJS actually has built-in features that allow you to add server-side rendering, "ReactDOMServer", but it is quite complex to use.) --> 

- <ins>File-based Routing</ins>, <!-- In traditional React, you don't even have a router, we need to install a third library called "React Router". Routing means we give the user the illusion of having multiple pages.--> define pages and routes with files and folders.

- <ins>Fullstack Capabilities</ins>, makes it easy to add backend code to React project. Add our own backend API using NodeJS code such as Storing data, getting data.
